IPTV app that I recommend: Kodi (with the IPTV Simple Client addon)

How to Install IPTV Simple Client:
Open Kodi -> Go to settings -> Select "Addons"  -> Select "Install from Repository" -> Go to " PVR Clients" -> Scroll down until you find " IPTV Simple Client" -> Select the Addon -> Click Install

How to set it up:
Go to "Settings" -> Select "PVR & Live TV" -> Select "PVR client addons" -> Select "IPTV Simple Client" -> Click " Configure" -> Select "Migrated addon settings" (or create a new configuration) -> Select "Remote path (Internet address)" -> Click M3U playlist URL -> Type the playlist link -> Click Done

For faster loading, set the settings mode to "Expert". Under the configuration of IPTV Simple Client, select "Migrated addon settings" -> Scroll down until you find "Advanced" (this only works if you already set the settings mode to Expert) -> Select "Use inputstream.adaptive for m3u8 (HLS) streams" -> Click Done

Playlist URLs

United States: https://bit.ly/PrimeVisionUS

United Kingdom: https://bit.ly/PrimeVisionUK

Australia: https://bit.ly/PrimeVisionAU

Tip: You can add multiple playlists in Kodi to merge the channels into one. All you need to do is to add the addon configurations specifically for the United Kingdom and/or Australian playlists and set what channel number will the playlists start at
